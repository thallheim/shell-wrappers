This repo is meant to house any wrappers I've found myself rewriting
time and again.

I'm not a shell expert by any stretch, so do take a good look before
using any of these, yeah? :)

## The wrappers

### cloc-wrapper ([AlDanial/cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc))

Uses sed to reflow the output, moving the author GH link, version string,
and stats to the first line. I find it much less distracting, for some
reason.
